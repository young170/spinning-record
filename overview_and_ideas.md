try fault injection

apply techniques from APR tools

can APR tools fix the bugs they made? or are they their worst enemies? what can we learn from this? are certain types better at 'catching' others? if the performance is poor, does this mean anything? does this apply for cases when they perform well?

how? need to design a pipeline that flips that of APR. then systematically apply to AMAP

bug input -> generation -> validation
